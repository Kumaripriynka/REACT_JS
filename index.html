 <!-- Made above project using React -->
  <!-- This file  contains all cores algorithm of react  -->
 <!-- <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script> -->

<!-- This file is use for dom operations or it is a react dom used to modify the dom -->
 <!-- <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script> -->

 <!-- // ***** The order of the above script files should be in same order, it's important to maintain the order ,if we rearrange the order it will through an error

 //  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is absolutely not a good way to inject React via CDN in our projects.
 // we should inject react directly to our project via npm command(i.e npm i react and npm i react-dom)
 

 // But after installing react and react dom we can't use react, we have to import it firstly in app.js file
// When we will import both it will through an error that browser script doesn't have export or import ,so we have to add type ="module "in our script file  -->

 <script type="module" src="./App.js" ></script>
